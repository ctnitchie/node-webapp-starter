A simple starting-point web web application incorporating

- Express
- React
- Bootstrap
- Sockets.io
- [lwrpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lwrpc)
- LESS for stylesheets
- Handlebars for server-side page templates
- Babel configured for ES6 and async/await
- Webpack for building the client assets

This is my own personal starting point, but might be useful to others.

Use

    npm start

to run in 'watch' mode. Use

    npm install
    npm run serve

to build and run from built artifacts.
