A simple starting-point web web application incorporating

- Express
- React
- Bootstrap
- Sockets.io
- [lwrpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lwrpc)
- LESS for stylesheets
- Handlebars for server-side page templates
- Babel configured for ES6 and async/await
- Webpack for building the client assets

This is my own personal starting point, but might be useful to others.
